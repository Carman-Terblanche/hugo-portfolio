I am a videographer who has a keen eye for images and scenery. I love experimenting with making good scenes look great!

### Early Life

I was born in Johannesburg, South Africa and grew up in Pretoria for most my life. I loved doing everything! From acting to sports to music and probably anything you can imagine. Finding a passion that sticks was difficult, so I tried combining them to make something new. 

### Later in Life

I gained a keen interest in web development and User Interface, so I created websites for fun and for other people who needed an online presence. But that wasn't enough. I needed something that will not only peak my interest, but also include my personality. So I started creating videos (which I have done so earlier in my life for fun). I used my dad's old phone in 2013 to create a short sketch of a boy being earily followed by a tyre (yes, a tyre) and they battled to the death. This video (unfortunately lost in the aether) kicked off my interest for creating videos and videography.

I had a YouTube channel when I was 12 where I created some skits and video tutorials for Photoshop and this gem:

But I grew in my video creation skills, and started creating more experimental skits. When I was 18, I created this short called **Trapped**

And now I am busy with my own YouTube endeavour to create content for shere pleasure and to help people with purchase decisions that you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa-HIPH3bElMyLVBqt611Qw?view_as=subscriber)
