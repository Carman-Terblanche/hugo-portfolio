      <description>I am a videographer who has a keen eye for images and scenery. I love experimenting with making good scenes look great!
Early Life I was born in Johannesburg, South Africa and grew up in Pretoria for most my life. I loved doing everything! From acting to sports to music and probably anything you can imagine. Finding a passion that sticks was difficult, so I tried combining them to make something new.</description>
