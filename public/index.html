                                    <span class="image main"><img src="" alt="" /></span>
                                    <p>I am a videographer who has a keen eye for images and scenery. I love experimenting with making good scenes look great!</p>
<h3 id="early-life">Early Life</h3>
<p>I was born in Johannesburg, South Africa and grew up in Pretoria for most my life. I loved doing everything! From acting to sports to music and probably anything you can imagine. Finding a passion that sticks was difficult, so I tried combining them to make something new.</p>
<h3 id="later-in-life">Later in Life</h3>
<p>I gained a keen interest in web development and User Interface, so I created websites for fun and for other people who needed an online presence. But that wasn&rsquo;t enough. I needed something that will not only peak my interest, but also include my personality. So I started creating videos (which I have done so earlier in my life for fun). I used my dad&rsquo;s old phone in 2013 to create a short sketch of a boy being earily followed by a tyre (yes, a tyre) and they battled to the death. This video (unfortunately lost in the aether) kicked off my interest for creating videos and videography.</p>
<p>I had a YouTube channel when I was 12 where I created some skits and video tutorials for Photoshop and this gem:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhlE2tHvJIc"> <img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/EhlE2tHvJIc/1.jpg" alt="Random Dance"></a></p>
<p>But I grew in my video creation skills, and started creating more experimental skits. When I was 18, I created this short called <strong>Trapped</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4g84zQaxWY"> <img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/k4g84zQaxWY/1.jpg" alt="Trapped"></a></p>
<p>And now I am busy with my own YouTube endeavour to create content for shere pleasure and to help people with purchase decisions that you can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa-HIPH3bElMyLVBqt611Qw?view_as=subscriber">here</a></p>
